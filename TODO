- Get ride of the 'PGconn.quote_ident' in the init.rb
- Catch ExecError in all controller actions using GitRepository
- Add default values for the branch folder names (feature/old_feature)
- Customize building feature branch name from issue-id. Current format: "issue_#{issue_id}"
- Add activity support to the feature branch (see lib/redmine/activity.rb)
- Rename feature_branches table to febee_feature_branches
- Ensure, that redmine is operatable without git repository online
- Wenn fetching or pushing use timeout. This should prevent hanging of the server in case ssh waiting for password from the console.
- Delete FeBEE records, if project get deleted
- Show error message, if <redmine>/tmp directory read-only
  Currently, if this is the case, the last missing field in the project
  configuration doesn't get saved without any error message. This occurs
  because of following: when last required field filled with data and
  validation of the project_configuration model passes, FeBEE tries to
  create the tmp file with the private key. The exception doesn't get
  catched, so entire HTTP request fails. The only possibility to find the
  error is to look into the log file (or console).

- Show update_interval in the project settings page 
- Moving to Gerrit and then merging works bad. Review link stays; wrong number of commits shows (number of merged commits, not commits moved to gerrit)
