- Get ride of the 'PGconn.quote_ident' in the init.rb
- Catch ExecError in all controller actions using GitRepository
- Save feature branches names without 'feature/'
- Add issue like info 'Updated by Redmine Admin 12 days ago' to feature branch view
- Add default values for the branch folder names (feature/old_feature)
- Customize building feature branch name from issue-id. Current format: "issue_#{issue_id}"
- Add activity support to the feature branch (see lib/redmine/activity.rb)
- When picking a unique branch name, check it against existing entries in the feature_branches table (the test scenario: a feature branch was created and then deleted in the git repository, but not in the feature_branches table. When new feature branch created, the same unique name will be chosen and a new entry with the same name in the feature_branches table will be created)
- Rename feature_branches table to febee_feature_branches
- Show update_interval in the project settings page 
- Ensure, that redmine is operatable without git repository online
- Wenn fetching or pushing use timeout. This should prevent hanging of the server in case ssk waiting for password from the  console.
- Delete FeBEE records, if project get deleted

- Moving to Gerrit and then merging works bad. Review link stays; wrong number of commits shows (number of merged commits, not commits moved to gerrit)
