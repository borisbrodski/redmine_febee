- Get ride of the 'PGconn.quote_ident' in the init.rb
- Catch ExecError in all controller actions using GitRepository
- Add default values for the branch folder names (feature/old_feature)
- Customize building feature branch name from issue-id. Current format: "issue_#{issue_id}"
- Add activity support to the feature branch (see lib/redmine/activity.rb)
- Rename feature_branches table to febee_feature_branches
- Ensure, that redmine is operatable without git repository online
- Wenn fetching or pushing use timeout. This should prevent hanging of the server in case ssh waiting for password from the console.
- Delete FeBEE records, if project get deleted

- Show update_interval in the project settings page 
- Moving to Gerrit and then merging works bad. Review link stays; wrong number of commits shows (number of merged commits, not commits moved to gerrit)

- Record screencast:
  - Install Gerrit + Redmine + eclipse + redmine_febee on the fresh Ubuntu installation
